# org-clock-stats

Make sense of the data that gets logged when using emacs org-mode to clock-in for tasks.

## TODO

### I should be able to use the total working days for the year for better stats

For example:
- Working days                     : 252
- voluntary and mandatory vacation : 22 + 3
- My working days                  : 227

### Date ranges for vacations

Need a list of specific date ranges (which shouldn't be included in workdays). I
want stats on actual workdays instead of weekdays.
